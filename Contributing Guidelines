Each team member has different responsibilities when it comes to making the edits in the code.

Heriberto
  He will be in charge of gathering the new sounds we would like for our game which include the sounds made when a game is won, when there 
  is a draw, each time a symbol is placed on the board, and the music continuing on the background while the game is being played. After 
  music, he will be responsible for determing which of the players will go first, by random chance.

Stephani
  She is in charge of changing the font of the text that appears in the beginninig of the game prompting the players to press enter as 
  well as the font that displays the words tic tac toe. She is also in charge of getting the game to prompt the players to enter their
  name in order to display who the winner is. When the game is over and someone had won, there will be a different screen displaying a
  colorful prompt to the winner saying they won. 

Shane
  He is in charge of creating the scoreboard for the game, counting the wins for players and displaying in command prompt. He will be 
  changing the background color, whichever time permits. He's going to expand the grid, changing the game from a 3x3 to a 5x5 and so on.
