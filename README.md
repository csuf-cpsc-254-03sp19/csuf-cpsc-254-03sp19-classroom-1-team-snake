The goal of our project is to use the existing tic tac toe code given and make minor modifications to it. We want to start off with simple changes such as using other symbols rather than the usual X and O. The differnt symbols will be different colors than red and yellow. The background color will also change or have a different background. There is music and sounds that we will be changing as well. Currently there is no prompt asking for the players names so that is something else we would wish to add. If two users were to continue playing, keeping track of their scores after each game would be something else we would like to implement. 

The existing code that we are using is written in C++ and the license used in that project is the MIT License as well as the Assess license for the music.
